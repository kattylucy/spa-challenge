Hi,

I really got stuck with RDK toolkit and typescript for a while. Normally I use react-query so It was a new experience using
RDK + typescript.

For that reason I didn't have time to add some tets. I wanted to add some cypress here.

Thank you for the consideration for the position and the time you are taking to read and understand the code.

yarn run start // to start the application
